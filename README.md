## Introduction

C++ is a powerful programming language that offers a wide range of libraries to help developers build efficient and robust applications. This repository provides detailed documentation for both default libraries that come with the C++ standard and popular community-driven libraries.

## Default C++ Libraries

### Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.

- **Containers**: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `set`, `map`, etc.
- **Algorithms**: `sort`, `find`, `copy`, `transform`, etc.
- **Iterators**: `begin`, `end`, `next`, `prev`, etc.
- **Function Objects**: `less`, `greater`, `bind`, etc.

### C Standard Library

The C Standard Library is a collection of functions and macros that provide support for various operations such as input/output, string manipulation, memory management, and mathematical computations.

- **Input/Output**: `printf`, `scanf`, `fopen`, `fclose`, etc.
- **String Manipulation**: `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strlen`, etc.
- **Memory Management**: `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc.
- **Mathematical Functions**: `sqrt`, `pow`, `sin`, `cos`, etc.

## Community Libraries

### Boost

Boost is a set of high-quality libraries that extend the functionality of C++. It provides support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing.

- **Key Libraries**: `boost::asio`, `boost::filesystem`, `boost::regex`, `boost::thread`, etc.
- **Documentation**: [Boost Documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/)

### Qt

Qt is a cross-platform framework for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase.

- **Key Features**: GUI development, networking, multithreading, SQL databases, etc.
- **Documentation**: [Qt Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/)

### OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains more than 2500 optimized algorithms for image and video analysis.

- **Key Features**: Image processing, video capture, object detection, machine learning, etc.
- **Documentation**: [OpenCV Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/)

### Eigen

Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.

- **Key Features**: Matrix and vector operations, solvers, geometry, etc.
- **Documentation**: [Eigen Documentation](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/)

### SFML

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a simple and fast multimedia library that provides a simple interface to various multimedia components.

- **Key Features**: Window management, graphics, audio, networking, etc.
- **Documentation**: [SFML Documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/)
